                    Welcome to my introduction page! I hope that you learn something interesting. I am currently a 
                    student at Brigham Young University studying cybersecurity. This will introduce
                    a little about me. Have a good read!

                        I graduated from high school in 2022. In high school, I focused on working 
                        on my grades while also participating in the high school string orchestra and the robotics team, where I was a
                        programmer.

                        I began studying as a <strong>computer science</strong> major at BYU in the fall of 2022. That year, I focused on 
                        accomplishing some GEs such as Statistics and American Heritage, while beginning on the entry-level CS courses, such 
                        as CS 111 and CS 235 (Data Structures). My goal with CS was to gain a broad understanding and then focus on the 
                        cybersecurity field. After a 2 year deferment to serve a mission, I decided to switch my major to <strong>cybersecurity</strong> 
                        to more fully pursue my professional interests, and so in 2025, I enrolled in an entry level cybersecurity class while
                        continuing to take some CS classes.

                <p>
                    I enjoy music and participated in a string orchestra and a rock band in high school. I also have an interest in 
                    computer science, of course, but especially cybersecurity and ethical hacking; this interest came when I was young 
                    after reading several books by Kevin Mitnick. I also enjoy swimming, biking, and a little bit of hiking. I especially just enjoy spending time with peple and gettin 
                    to know them more. <em>I also enjoy learning, though I do have a bit of a love-hate relationship with school at the moment.</em>

                <p>
                    I have some CS experience from both high school and college. I was a programmer for a robotics team and gained
                    experience working with other members of a team--electrical, mechanical, etc.--to build a product. As mentioned
                    before, I have also taken several college CS classes. I also have other experiences that have taught me a lot;
                    <strong>I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</strong> in 2023-2025, 
                    which taught me a lot spiritually and about serving others.
